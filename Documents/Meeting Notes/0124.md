Meeting outcome was assigning front and back end teams  and choosing frameworks to use from research. 

Front end - React, Back end - Flask.
### Belal/Humza:
| **Since Last Meeting** | Researched Flask framework, found it versatile, simple and easy to learn. Although it has limited tooling and you must learn extensions as you go. |

### Spencer/Luke:
| **Since Last Meeting** | Researched Django, found it to not have a steep learning curve. Has a built in authenticate method, admin suite and database. Although it has a steeper learning curve than flask and was difficult to use/set up. |

### Natasha/Liu:
